John Paul Ward is a Senior Commercial Producer at ENERGY BBDO in Chicago, IL. He joined BBDO in 2015 as a Production Coordinator. Since joining BBDO he’s produced campaigns for Jack Daniels, Alka Seltzer, HP, Lenscrafters, Ziploc and Dr Scholl’s. As a lifelong lover of fantastical cinema, he’s been producing his own shorts ever since his parents brought home a VHS camcorder and he could film his action figures in battles on Lego sets. Outside of work John Paul can be found jumping in Lake Michigan with his GoPro and dancing to anything made in the 80s. He holds a BA in Sociology from Georgia State University.
